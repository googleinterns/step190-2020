# gVote

gVote is a voter information platform that walks users through steps in the U.S. voting procedure by: 
1. Helping users register to vote.
2. Listing the relevant elections coming up.
3. Providing details about each election, including ballot information and nearby polling sites, so users are ready to vote on election day. 

You can find the deployed site at [contrib-geo-step-2020.appspot.com](https://contrib-geo-step-2020.appspot.com/).
